# LeagueDesigner
LeagueDesigner is a  League of Legends website focused on enabling users to design their own League of Legends characters (known as "Champions"). The site will provide tools such as calculators and a way to collaborate with other users on the same project like github does.

# Features
1. Design and submit a Champion, which can be peer-rated and reviewed.
2. Calculators to aid in design, such as: per-level/at-maximum-level statistics, potential damage with items, %missing/%maximum damage, mitigated armor/magic resist/movement speed after damage/slows, crowd control reduction time after tenacity, etc.
3. Collaboration with other users on the same Champion.
